<Danger>
  The plan **Saturn Basic** has been removed and can't be claimed or bought. We did this change as having different plans made it hard to manage and purchase slots and we feel removing it is for the better. All current plans on Saturn Basic can be moved to the Saturn Plus plan by running `/subscription > Migrate`.
